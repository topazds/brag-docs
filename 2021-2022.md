A business travel application with full functionality to book flights, hotels, and rental cars.

This is the first project in which I worked with Swift and SwiftUI. I gained a lot of knowledge about the iOS side. Actually, I worked on the Android side before. I have a fantastic opportunity to improve my skills.

* Re-designed the Coordinator stack & Data Flow to support the Post-booking flow.
* Replaced FSCalendar with airbnb/HorizonCalendar and custom it to meet the old design.
* Observed & fixed the memory leak issues
* Re-designed an Accessibility VoiceOver/VoiceControl framework to use in the whole app.
* Designed the payload & integrated the Splank log to capture the info & error log level.
* Collaborated with others to push the adaptive auto layout support up to AX5.
* Created the reuseable SwiftUI components to use in the whole app along with design system.

* Implemented the screens with UIKit including
  - CarRental Details
  - Flight Details
  - Hotel Detail
  - User Preference
