## Collaboration & Mentorship
* Memories leak debugging (iOS) - there is work related to mobility to create the entrance component along with the current flow.
A lot of screens need to be enhanced and supported by the new small component. The leak happened during the integration.
* Data flow & mapping with the current architecture (Fiji-web)
* Boundary of Service, Action and Store (Fiji-web)

## Design & Documentation
* How to use & set up the Storybook on Fiji-web documents

## Projects
### DEEM - Mobility - [Deem for business travel - AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/ae/app/deem-for-business-travel/id1477594097)
I worked on the Etta app with Swift before I moved to the mobility team and focused on the functionality of booking an Uber to the airport through the mobile application.

* Entrance component from the iOS app (SwiftUI)
* Integrated the Uber business flow into the Etta app (Swift & SwiftUI).
* Search result screen & transition with Google Maps (React)
* Location refinement (React)
* Mobility's confirmation screen (React)
* Booking and location refinement services (Golang)

### DEEM - PWA - [Deem for business travel - GooglePlay](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.deem.app.twa&hl=en&gl=US)
The application is built as a PWA and focuses only on the Android operating system. It supports both desktop and mobile versions in order to provide a seamless user experience across devices.

We take over projects from other teams with 0% unit testing. They trust that the component test is enough to drive the development process. However, relying solely on component testing may not provide comprehensive coverage for the entire project. Unit testing plays a crucial role in identifying and fixing bugs at a granular level, ensuring the overall stability and reliability of the software. 

* Built the Activation flow for User onboarding (Manual flow)
* Supported the User and fixed the Major & Minor Bugs (Fiji-web) - the bug might come from the QA in our team or the user reported it.
* Increased the Unit-tests, UI-tests, Component-tests to area we touched as much as possible (Fiji-web)

### Rose Holmes Cattery - [roseholmescattery.com](https://roseholmescattery.com/)
The back office of the cattery, to manage the vaccines, etc., planned to have more features, making it easier to track the family ancestry of the cats they have, which color they carry, and the percentage of inbreeding to avoid the risks. 

This would ensure the health and well-being of future generations by preventing genetic disorders and promoting responsible breeding practices. 
Additionally, it would also help breeders make informed decisions regarding pairing cats for optimal genetic diversity.

* Google sign in for only who got the kitten from us
* Vaccines for kitten's countdown (1 month)
* Year vaccine's countdown
* Showing alert if the vaccine almost meet the due date
* Pregnancy countdown
* The profile for each cat (DOB, Color code, Color name...)
* Showing relationship of kitten and their parent and group with the name of Litter (A, B, C ...)
* Dark mode
* Separate the screen for customers & farm
