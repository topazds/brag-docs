## Projects

### KPlUS - SME (Backend) - [KPLUS - SME](https://www.kasikornbank.com/th/business/sme/digital-banking/pages/kplus_sme.aspx)

It's the application for a specific user that has the SME business. It's my first job as a backend using Spring MVC.

- Enhancement of the Cheque’s service 
- Collaborated with the 3rd party and exposed the new API to the client which is the mobile side. 
- Improved the error type of FlowAccount giving better UX to the user through the application. 
- Supported the incident and deployment.
- Increased the whole project test coverage to over 80%.

### KPLUS (Android) - [KPLUS - PlayStore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kasikorn.retail.mbanking.wap&hl=th)

I spent some time working as a backender. Lots of changes occur when the K-Plus platform wishes to improve and enhance the application. the new API endpoint as well as the entire design. They are thus requesting a large number of engineers to join their team and complete the necessary tasks before the first release. I propose to join since I will have the chance to get knowledge of frontend stuff.

- Took responsibility for the Mutual fund feature (Implement & Improvement). - I managed the three-person team that worked on the extremely complex functionality, which involved using the MPChart library for a considerable amount of time. The flow has a significant amount of charting. It presents a challenge to me. I have to pick things up quickly and operate efficiently.


- Built the components and screens including
  - Chart customization e.g. LineChart and PieChart to meet the UI designs. - Worked with Vietnam team.
  - Account balance
  - Credit Card Balance
  - Withdrawal (QR, barcode rendering)
  - Payment receipt & Seasonal receipt 
    - This is the part I like because there is a requirement to fill the color to the bottom that should relate to the background recipe. We generate it via the last pixel of the image that returns from the API, fill that color to the end of that layout.
  - Bank Transfer (Screen & Transition)
  - Converted the Java codebases to Kotlin.
  - Android SDK migration.
  - Supported user incidents on their site.
  - Introduced Test Coverage report to Jenkins pipeline.

### KTB - Paotang (Backend) - [Paotang](https://krungthai.com/th/content/personal/paotang)
The most important thing I learned from this is the concurrency request because Paotang has a big campaign. Concurrency is crucial because it allows multiple tasks to be executed simultaneously, resulting in increased efficiency and productivity.

- Implemented the reactive microservices for "กยศ." and "เราเที่ยวด้วยกัน" with Spring Boot and Spring Webflux.
- Collaborated with the infra team in setting up the environment and deployment for dev & production.
- Used to Monitor tools the transaction that might overflow and prevent the risk for the production release.
- Load Testing - using JMeter
- DB performance tuning
- Improved the Logging System
