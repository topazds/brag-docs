### Rose Holmes Cattery - [roseholmescattery.com](https://roseholmescattery.com/)
The back office of the cattery, to manage the vaccines, etc., planned to have more features, making it easier to track the family ancestry of the cats they have, which color they carry, and the percentage of inbreeding to avoid the risks. 
This would ensure the health and well-being of future generations by preventing genetic disorders and promoting responsible breeding practices. 
Additionally, it would also help breeders make informed decisions regarding pairing cats for optimal genetic diversity.
